Hello! My name is Kanishk Kacholia and I'm a current student at the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities. I'm a programmer with several years of experience, having first been introduced to it in 6th grade through game automation. Today, my sights are set high and I continue to explore new and upcoming technologies. Through my time studying, and through my several projects I am proficient in Python, Django, HTML/CSS/Javascript, Numpy/Pandas, SQL, and much more. In the future I hope to pursue an education in both Computer Science and Data Science.
